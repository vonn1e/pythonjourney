    "## Different Classes with same Method Names\n",
    "\n",
    "This word sounds crazy... I know but it's not that hard to understand when you think about how Python is using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is when you have different Classes have the same method name. You would do this so you can call those methods from the same place passing in different objects - it's like the method magically \"morphs\" to know which method to call based on the arguments passed to the method\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's a use case for this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you may want to build a method called open() to open files right? But there are JPEG files, CSV files, PDF files... there's so many right? \n",
    "\n",
    "You could create a base class for opening files and then inherit the base from a derived Class for JPEGs and then another derived Class for CSV files and another one for PDF files... all sharing the same method name open() but each Class will return its own unique object based on the file type open request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's just dive in so you can see how this stuff works!\n",
